# SY0-701-study-with-me
Placeholder for comptia Security+ notes as I study for the exam. The notes will be in my own words and placed here in hopes that it can help some of yall taking the exam. 
Currently relying mostly  on Proffessor Messer's resources but all the content here will be a "rewritten" format for me to understand better. I will update it in the span of the 2 1/2 months I have to study for this exam.
I will create a new folder for each topic for easier understanding following Professor Messer's naming convention
